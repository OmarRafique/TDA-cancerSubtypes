To run the code, download and place all the files in one folder and open 'Subtyping_Lung_data.R'. Run this file line by line to replicate the results of the paper.

"Subtyping_Lung_data.R" contains the diensionality reduction and topological  clustering  as explained in the paper. Some validation methods in the paper have been adapted from other works, especially https://github.com/angy89/RobustSparseCorrelation. Their code is available on this link but has been uploaded here too.
